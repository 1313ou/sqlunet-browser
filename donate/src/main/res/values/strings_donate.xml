	<string name="text_donate">SqUNet browser comes free to you. Just as simple as that. But the project took me a number of years to carry out and this really meant hard work, first building the SQL database then the Android application. I did it out of passion and do not beg for money.
		But if you like the result and think it deserves your contribution and you can afford it, please donate to support the developer\'s work</string>
