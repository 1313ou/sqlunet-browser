        No glob.
        string exactly matching project-relative path [platform dependent]
        string prefix for project-relative path [platform dependent] (e.g. subfolder)
        The following has to start with `res`:
            string exactly matching res folder-relative path [platform independent]
            string prefix for res folder-relative path [platform independent]

		[2]
        It is either absolute or relative. (Probably both? Have not tested though).
		When it is relative, it is relative to the root of the module (where build.gradle is located).
		You can always use **/ wild card like <ignore path="**/res/layout/activation.xml" /> to make it relative to any path.
